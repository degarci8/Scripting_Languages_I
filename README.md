# Scripting_Languages_I

This is a repository I created for my Scripting Languages I class. Programming Language: Python

In this class, I went over many basic concepts such as variables, functions, loops, etc... As a beginner-level course, I was able to grasp the fundamentals of programming and gain an understanding of how programmers think when writing code. Inside this repository, you will find examples of my work throughout the class.
